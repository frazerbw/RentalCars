This program consists of a java application that is built into a 'JAR' file

The 'JAR' is then used by the node js server (node server/server.js) to respond to POST requests

POST requests can be tested using the node js POST utility script (node server/post_request.js)

TASK LIST:

1: Print a list of all the cars, in ascending price order
2: Print a list of the specifications for each car
3: Print out the highest rated supplier per car type, descending order
4: Print out a list of vehicles, ordered by the sum of the scores in descending order

HOW TO RUN:

1) navigate to the 'node server' folder
2) node server.js
3) node post_request.js x       [replace x with a task number from the TASK LIST]

-

Testing is rather limited and only cover the Vehicle class for the java application.

If I were to spend more time on this system I would introduce tests for the POST requests
too using a test version of vehicles.json.
